					it is often overwhelming to enter the world of HTML and CSS, 
					but like every other language, tasks are often simpler than 
					what we think.
				</p>

				<p>
					There are numerous online tutorials that "garuantee" to 
					teach you everything you need to know about programming, 
					but are they trustworthy? Are they telling you the truth 
					and nothing but the truth, or are they just seeking profit? 
					Are their intentions pure? Or is their only purpouse to spam 
					you with ads for their own gain?

				</p>

				<p>
					Citizens of the digital age, IF you're looking for a way to 
					master the true ways of the internet, for a way to open your 
					world, then we invite you to join us on our journey to the 
					lion's den, for we shall uncover the secrets of HTML and CSS 
					once and for all, the secrets that you have not been taught
