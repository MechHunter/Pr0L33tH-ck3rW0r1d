				Where to begin?
			</h1>
			<p>
				Well, if you want to start somewhere, its a good idea to begin with a sound understanding of how the internet manages the ridiculous amount of info it houses and just how it works.
			</p>


			<h2>
				The world wide web (WWW)
			</h2>
			<p>
				The world wide web, better known as WWW, is probably the most widely heard of concept of the internet, but few know exactly what it is.
			</p>
			<p>
				Generally, the internet is just a network of millions and millions of data banks connected to an even larger, diverse group of devices ranging from laptops to computers to whatever that uses that data;</p>
			<p>
				all those devices can then use a program called a browser, which can speak to the web servers, and make requests for content they need or rather, what the client needs.</p>
			<p>
				once the relevant web server recieves said requests, provided they do not run into any restrictions on the client device ( i.e. Firewalls, encryptions, Permission restrictions, etc.... ), it will generate the related webpage or data and send it to the client device through the aforementioned browser software; in conjunction with the client device, the browser will translate the recieved data to forms viable to the client device.
